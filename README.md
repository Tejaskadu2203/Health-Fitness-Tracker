The Health & Fitness Tracker is a data analytics project that tracks and analyzes daily health metrics such as Steps, Calories, and Sleep Hours. Using Python (NumPy & Pandas), a synthetic dataset of 490+ days was generated and cleaned, including the creation of a derived column for Sleep Quality (Good if ≥ 7 hours, Poor otherwise).

The cleaned data was then exported to Excel, where an interactive dashboard was built using Pivot Tables, Pivot Charts, and Slicers. The dashboard provides insights into:

📈 Trends → Monthly progression of Steps and Calories

🥧 Distribution → Good vs Poor Sleep days

📊 Comparisons → Average Sleep Hours by Month

🟦 Frequency → Steps distribution across activity ranges (Histogram)

🔍 Interactivity → Slicers for filtering by Month, Sleep Quality, and Calorie Level

🎯 Key Outcomes

Identified activity trends and sleep patterns across 490+ days

Found relationship between steps and calorie levels

Visualized sleep quality and its effect on calorie activity

Built a professional Excel dashboard suitable for real-world analysis
